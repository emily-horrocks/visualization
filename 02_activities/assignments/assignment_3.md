# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
Good visualization example:

The Statista chart on Mac sales as a percentage of Appleâ€™s revenue is relatively accessible and equitable, however it is not reproducible. In terms of accessibility, the chart uses clear labels and a simple bar chart format, which makes it easy to read and understand. However, it could be more accessible for individuals with visual impairments by considering color contrast as it uses mostly shades of blues. It also includes relevant graphics that makes it easier for users to grasp context. The chart is equitable as it displays the data in a straightforward manner with no unnecessary complexity. While the chart is visually clear, it lacks reproducibility as there is no explicit reference to the data source and methodolgy used.

Bad visualization example:

The Figma Polar UI Kit chart infographic is not accessible, reproducible, or equitable. Its use of colour gradients and overlapping elements makes it inaccessible to individuals with visual impairments, (as it lacks high contrast). The absence of clear labeling or explanatory text further increases cognitive load, excluding viewers who may rely on screen readers or require simpler visual designs. Reproducibility is also a significant issue, as the visualization does not provide data sources, methodology, or explanations of how the visual representation was created, making it impossible to replicate. Furthermore, the design is inequitable as it caters primarily to users with advanced visual literacy, alienating those with different levels of education or familiarity with the context. 

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  

Good visualization example:

To improve the Statista chart on Mac sales as a percentage of Appleâ€™s revenue, I suggest several adjustments that could enhance its accessibility and reproducibility. First, to improve accessibility, the chart could use a better colour palette with high contrast between the bars and background to ensure it is readable for those with visual impairments (as it is a variety of blue shades). To improve reproducibility, the visualization should include a link to the source of the data and detailed methodology (how the data was processed and visualized). 


Bad visualization example:

To improve the Figma Polar UI Kit chart infographic data visualization in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, and equity, Is suggest several adjustments. Simiarly to the first example, for accessibility, the design should replace color gradients and overlapping elements with high-contrast solid colors that are appropriate for individuals with visual impairments. To improve reproducibility, the visualization should include a link to the source of the data and detailed methodology (how the data was processed and visualized). Providing this context builds trust and allows the opportunity for others to verify or replicate the visualization. Lastly, to enhance equity, the design should prioritize clarity by using simple layout and including additional text explaining the context so the data is understandable. These changes would make the visualization more inclusive, reliable, and equitable for all users.



- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
